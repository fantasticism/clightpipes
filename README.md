# LightPipes

> Simulations of optical phenomena where diffraction is essential

[![travis-ci](https://api.travis-ci.org/opticspy/lightpipes.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/opticspy/lightpipes)

LightPipes is a set of functions written in C++. It is designed to model coherent optical devices when the diffraction is essential.

The toolbox consists of a number of functions. Each function represents an optical element or a step in the light propagation. There are apertures, intensity filters, beam-splitters, lenses and models of free space diffraction. There are also more advanced tools for manipulating the phase and amplitude of the light. The program operates on a large data structure, containing square two-dimensional arrays of complex amplitudes of the optical field of the propagating light beam.

The LightPipes routines are modifications of the LightPipes C routines written by Gleb Vdovin for Unix, Linux, DOS and OS2 workstations.

Visit the website of **Flexible Optical**: [http://www.okotech.com](http://www.okotech.com), where you can find the source code of *LightPipes* and a *manual*.

## Install

LightPipes support Windows 32bit and 64bit, Macintosh OSX, Linux 32bit and 64bit. It support python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 currently.
The newest version, 1.2.0, can also be installed on a Raspberry Pi with Python 3.7.

The packages are on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LightPipes/), so simply open a terminal window and type at the prompt:

```python
pip install LightPipes
```

You can also download packages from [Releases](https://github.com/opticspy/lightpipes/releases).

## Example: Young interferometer

A plane wave is diffracted by two small holes, separated a distance, d. So two more or less spherical waves will propagate from these holes.

The resulting interference pattern on a screen at distance z looks like:

The Python program [Young.py](Examples/Interference/Young.py) described in detail.

The first step in *Python* is to import the *LightPipes* library:

```python
from LightPipes import *
```
Besides the *LightPipes* library, we import units and a few more in this way.

If the *LightPipes* library is successful installed on your computer Python can proceed with the next step.
You probably want to plot the results, so import *matplotlib*:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Next we define some variables: a wavelength of 20 micrometer , a 30 x 30 mm2 square grid with 500 x 500 pixels.

```python
wavelength = 20*um
size = 30.0*mm
N = 500
```

Now we are ready to start the simulation. The *Begin* command generates a field with amplitude 1.0 and phase zero, a plane wave. So, all the 500 x 500 elements of array, F, contain the complex number: 1.0 + j0.0.
The next commands generate two waves, F1 and F2, which are apertured by the two circular apertures and combined (simply added) by the *BeamMix* command. The combined wavefront is propagated a distance z=30 cm by the *Fresnel* command. After that the intensity is caculated and normalized to 255 (2 -> 255, 1 -> 1.0, 0 -> not normalized) by the *Intensity* command.

```python
F = Begin(size,wavelength,N)
F1 = CircAperture(0.15*mm, -0.6*mm,0, F)
F2 = CircAperture(0.15*mm, 0.6*mm,0, F)    
F = BeamMix(F1,F2)
F = Fresnel(10*cm,F)
I = Intensity(2,F)
```

The result is plotted using the fantastic *matplot* routines. We are not interested in axis around the pattern and we like to write a title above the plot.

```python
plt.imshow(I, cmap='rainbow');
plt.axis('off');
plt.title('intensity pattern')
plt.show()
```
